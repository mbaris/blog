Hi, i am Mehmet Barış Kalkar, a computer engineer based in Ankara, Turkey. I work as a software developer at [OpsGenie](https://opsgenie.com).

I am interested in procedural generation, devops, scalable and efficient software development.

I also like reading fantasy novels, running and cooking in my free time.

This blog will serve as a place to share what i am learning and a platform to try new technologies like react, gatsby, github-pages, cloudflare etc.
