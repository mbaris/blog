Hi, I am Mehmet Barış Kalkar, a computer engineer located in Berlin, Germany. 
Currently, I started working as a software engineer at [Klarna.](https://www.klarna.com/) recently. Previously I have worked at [Atlassian OpsGenie](https://opsgenie.com) for around 4 years. I am interested in learning more about DevOps, modern web applications, and scalable and efficient software development best practices.

I also like reading fantasy novels, playing video games, snowboarding, running in my free time.

This blog will serve as a place to share what I am learning and a platform to try new technologies like react, gatsby, github-pages, cloudflare etc.
